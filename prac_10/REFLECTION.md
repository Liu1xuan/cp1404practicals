# Reflection
- Estimates for Practical Tasks: At first, we often misjudged the time and resources needed for programming tasks.

- Code Reviews: Getting my code reviewed helped me see where I can improve and learn new techniques. 

- Changes to Practical Tasks: I would add more real-life tasks to make the coursework more relatable and interesting.
